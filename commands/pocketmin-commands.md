Commands:
 - gms usage: /gms | Changes your gamemode to survival
 - gmc usage: /gmc | Changes your gamemode to creative
 - gma usage: /gma | Changes your gamemode to adventure
 - gmspc usage: /gmspc | Changes your gamemode to spectator
 Note:not sure how spectator works in Pocket Edition, but you may find this useful.
 - slay usage: /slay <player> | Kills the specified player
 - heal usage: /heal [player] | This heals you, or, if specified, another player.
 - mute usage: /mute <player> | This will mute the specified player.
 - unmute usage: /unmute <player> | Unmutes the specified player.
 - freeze usage: /freeze <player>
 Freezes a player so that they can't move. When you're frozen, it tends to have graphical glitches or make you stuck in the ground (for me its both); I believe this is just a bug in PocketMine-MP. In future updates to PocketMine-MP it should be fixed.
 - unfreeze usage: /unfreeze <player> | Unfreezes the specified player.
