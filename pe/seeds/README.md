Cave Spawn seed is a unique seed in which you will spawn in a cave. Yes, a cave! Right in front of you when you spawn there will be one block of emeralds. Behind of you there will be some more surprises – three blocks of gold ores!


The problem however, is that you haven’t got any wood to make a pickaxe so you’ll have to dig your way up to the ground and find some and then come down there again and start mining.

The big deal about this seed is that you spawn in a cave naturally without having to dig down through lots of cobblestone or find some open cave to wander into.

Another quite weird thing about the seed is that it is super hard to find a way out without actually digging.
