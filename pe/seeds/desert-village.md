Spawn on grass surrounded by desert. Walk foward untill you get over a small hill, Desert village will be across the river. That Desert Survival tho! 

Blacksmith Loot as follows:
- 1 Iron Chestplate
- 5 Bread
- 2 Saddle
- 6 Ink Sac
- 6 Obsidian

Even though theres alot of desert around you, there is alot of caves to explore. They are rich in ore and coal, plus theres a lava pit nearby (forgot where exactly). A word a caution! Bring enough axes to dig yourselve out! A good amount of torches as well, also some of the caves have big drops. Overall I must say I spent a good amount of time exploring. The village was just a place to put a bed and use it as respawn point (also got lazy and didnt build a house just put a door on the blacksmith house).

###### Notes
works with Survival and Creative, must be in Infinite mode.
