# MoreCommands | PocketMine Forums

For PocketMine-MP:
: 1.4.0 or above

**\-------MoreCommands-------**â€‹

This plugin provides you with useful commands as shown below:  
**ALL **of these commands require op by default. You'll need to use a permissions manager plugin to let others use the commands provided.

**Commands:**  
\- **gms** usage: /gms | Changes your gamemode to survival  
\- **gmc** usage: /gmc | Changes your gamemode to creative  
\- **gma** usage: /gma | Changes your gamemode to adventure  
\- **gmspc** usage: /gmspc | Changes your gamemode to spectator  
** Note**:not sure how spectator works in Pocket Edition, but you may find this useful.  
\- **slay **usage: /slay  | Kills the specified player  
\- **heal **usage: /heal [player] | This heals you, or, if specified, another player.  
\- **mute **usage: /mute  | This will mute the specified player.  
\- **unmute **usage: /unmute  | Unmutes the specified player.  
\- **freeze **usage: /freeze   
Freezes a player so that they can't move. When you're frozen, it tends to have graphical glitches or make you stuck in the ground (for me its both); I believe this is just a bug in PocketMine-MP. In future updates to PocketMine-MP it should be fixed.  
\- **unfreeze **usage: /unfreeze  | Unfreezes the specified player.

See the update tab for update details. Also, this update requires api 1.4.0 or above now(the latest stable build is good).  
I hope you all enjoy this plugin! Feedback is appreciated! ![;\)][1]
